# GRAD Civilians

<img src="docs/gradcivs_logo.svg" width="400" />

Spawn ambient civilians on the map.

[![Issues](https://img.shields.io/github/issues/gruppe-adler/grad-civs.svg)](https://github.com/gruppe-adler/grad-civs/issues)

## Features

* automatically populate the map with civilians
* dedicated to
    * doing foot patrols
    * driving around the country
    * living in houses (that they leave only to visit their neighbors)
* everything is automatically offloaded to Headless Clients (if available)
* interactions with players:
    * stop and raise their hands when threatened with weapons
    * vehicles will stop when you gesture at them (ACE 'hold' gesture)
    * ACE interactions: "back up vehicle", "carry on"
    * will move out of player's way when getting honked at
* will panic and flee in firefights
* civilian *players* get visual aids when trying to pose as AI civilians (like, if they're being pointed at with a gun, told to go away by ACE interact, ...)
* when players steal civilian vehicles, CBA events will be thrown
    * needs the 'gta' module enabled
    * depends on the affected civilians observing the vehicle being taken / the player driving it
    


## Dependencies

* [CBA_A3](https://github.com/CBATeam/CBA_A3)
* [ACE3](https://github.com/acemod/ACE3)

## Installation

*It's a mod now, baby!*

Do grab a zip file from the releases page, or look it up on the Steam Workshop where it may or may not appear sometime.

## Usage Notes

To avoid micro lags / fps dips on the server, it is recommended to add a headless client to your scenarios.

If that is not possible, civilian group size (looking at you, [Ikarus 260](https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikarus_260)!) as well as total population count should be kept small.

Civilians on separate islands can run into pathing problems. Avoid by creating exclusion zones.

## Config

Settings can be found as CBA Addon settings.

## 3DEN modules

### exclusion zone

Blacklist an area for civs by syncing it to a trigger. Exclusion zones override population zones in the same area.

### population zone

Whitelist an area for civs by syncing it to a trigger.

*NOTE: if no population zone is defined, the whole map will be considered a population zone.*

## API

### EVENTS

#### global

    // make sure the gta module is enabled
    // may fire twice for a given vehicle 
    //   * first with thief := objNull 
    //   * then with _thief being a unit
    ["grad_civs_vehicleTheft", { params ["_vehicle", "_thief"]; }] call CBA_fnc_addEventHandler;
    ["grad_civs_civKilled", { params ["_deathPos", "_killer"]; }] call CBA_fnc_addEventHandler;

### grad_civs_legacy_fnc_doCustomActivity

To let civilians break from their usual activity and do something else for a limited time.

Example:

```
[
    _civ,                               
    { _this#0 setBehaviour "STEALTH" },
    { _this#0 setBehaviour "CARELESS" },
    600,                                
    [],                                 
    "hiding",                           
    "pooped my pants, hiding for ten minutes"
] call grad_civs_legacy_fnc_doCustomActivity;
```

**NOTE**: this whole thing will *NOT* work while they are panicking.

**NOTE**: do clean up after yourself in the `_doEnd` parameter. reset disableAI stuff etc!

*known issues: pathing through area is not checked. To minimize that problem, define exclusionZones with large diameter.*

#### Syntax

`[_trigger] call grad_civs_common_fnc_addExclusionZone;`  

## Development

* we're using the CBA state machine implementation, see `addons/*/functions/sm_*/`
* there's also some extensions being done to the CBA state machnie implementation to allow for nested states and other shenanigans, see addons/cba_statemachine
* if you add states or transitions, please update the DOT files in `/docs`
    * which is where you'll find the compiled SVG files, too.
    * install [Graphviz](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/) and generate them using `dot -Tsvg states.gv > states.svg` or use an online editor   

### state stot wot?

worry not, here comes a friendly introduction:

**CBA state machine for dummies**

#### what are state machines

A state machine is a construct made of states and transitions between states. It can be visualized very easily as a directed graph with nodes (states) and edges (transitions). The state machine gets fed with a bunch of entities that inhabit the states. It periodically checks the states and moves the entities along the transitions from one state to the next.

#### how do they look like with CBA

Let's have a very simple example:

```sqf
MY_CIV_LIST = ["C_Offroad_01_F" createVehicle position player];
_machine = [{MY_CIV_LIST}] call CBA_statemachine_fnc_create;
_state_init = [_machine, { diag_log "init"; }, { diag_log "onEnter_init" }, { diag_log "onExit_init" }] call grad_civs_legacy_fnc_addState;
_state_stuff = [_machine, {diag_log "wörk" }, {diag_log "onEnter_wörk"}, {}] call grad_civs_legacy_fnc_addState;
_transition = [_machine, _state_init, _state_stuff, {CBA_missionTime > 30}, {diag_log "changing state" }] call grad_civs_legacy_fnc_addTransition;
```

this will print something like this to RPT:

```
onEnter_init
init
# … (until CBA_missionTime > 30)
init
onExit_init
changing state
onEnter_wörk
wörk
wörk
# …
```

#### how do we use them

In our case, and with CBA state machines, that means:

* we have a bunch of state machines, chief of which is the *activities* state machine. It is implemented in `/functions/sm_activities/fn_activities.sqf`
* states are added to it using [grad_civs_legacy_fnc_addState](https://cbateam.github.io/CBA_A3/docs/files/statemachine/fnc_addState-sqf.html) .
    * every state has a bunch of callbacks that are called with a civilian as parameter
        * one is called periodically as long as the civ is in the state
        * one is called when the civ enters the state
        * one is called when the civ leaves the state
* transitions are being added by using [grad_civs_legacy_fnc_addTransition](https://cbateam.github.io/CBA_A3/docs/files/statemachine/fnc_addTransition-sqf.html) (or fnc_addEventTransition for transitions triggered by CBA events)
    * every transition is defined as a one-way connection between two states
    * every transition gets two callbacks
        * one is called periodically to check whether a civ can move along the transition
        * the second is called once when the civ actually makes the transition
* The state machine can get big quickly.
    * The callbacks should not execute code directly, but execute in separate functions:
        * states in `fn_sm_activities_state_<name>_(loop|enter|exit).sqf`
        * transitions in `fn_sm_activities_trans_<state1>_<state2>_(condition|handler).sqf`
    * this makes for easier Profiling using the [Arma Script Profiler](https://github.com/dedmen/ArmaScriptProfiler)
    * and reduces file size for `fn_sm_activities.sqf`

#### what it looks like

This is the current structure (plz update when you change anything!):
